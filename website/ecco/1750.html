        <h1>Eighteenth Century Collections Online Sample from 1750</h1>
        <div id="content">
            <p id="other">The results from the Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO) Database for 1750 returned a consistent variety in the forms of <i>cheap</i> used and seen in <a href="1715.html">the 1715 sample</a>. However, in this year, I was able to find uses of <i>cheap</i> as an adverb which was not seen in past centuries. This indicated, to me, that the verb and adjective use were becoming increasingly common in the language thus allowing for a hybrid of the two to form. Again, there were increased occurances of the verb use in comparison to the 17th century and the meanings associated, to the verbs, remained consistent to the <a href="../ebbo.html">samples found in EBBO</a> and <a href="1715.html">the 1715 sample</a>. The adjective uses also remained relatively consistent in meaning with the variety found in <a href="1715.html">the 1715 sample</a>. I chose a majority of adjective and verb samples where the uses seemed most closely related to the new adverb form to represent my hypothesis that the two forms present in past centuries were responsible in the formation of the new form. I also made sure to include at least one use of the adjective with the increasingly negative meaning as representation that the adjective continued in this part of the century to become more negative.</p>
