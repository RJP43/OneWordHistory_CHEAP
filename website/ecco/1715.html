        <h1>Eighteenth Century Collections Online Sample from 1715</h1>
        <div id="content">
            <p id="other">The results from the Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO) Database for 1715 returned a great variety in the forms of <i>cheap</i> used. However,in this century, the use of the noun form <i>cheap</i> was no longer present. There were increased occurances of the verb use in comparison to the 17th century. The meanings associated, to the verbs, remained consistent to the samples found in <a href="../ebbo.html">EBBO</a>. The adjective forms also remained relatively consistent in meaning with the variety found in the previous century, but there was an increase in the occurrences of the adjective use that indicated a more negative representation of the noun being referred to as <i>cheap</i>. In some instances the negative adjective use brought the noun being described into further disdain than seen in previous centuries by making a determination of lower value with out the basis of the said noun's familiarity and commonality. The other adjective uses were similar to that of past centuries being declarations of cost. I attempted to represent the increase use of the adjective variety by choosing a majority of adjectives for my sample. I chose samples of the uses seen in previous centuries as well as several examples of the use with an increasingly negative connotation. I also wanted to represent the continued use of the verb form and the standardization of the verb representation as <i>cheapen</i> from the previous century and did so by adding multiple samples of such.</p>
