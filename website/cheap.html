            <p id="first">***This website is an in-depth investigation of the word <i>cheap</i>. Created as the final research project for the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg's History of the English Language Course taught by <a href="http://www.greensburg.pitt.edu/people/sayre-n-greenfield-phd">Dr. Greenfield</a>; this project describes the usage of <i>cheap</i> in the English language. I will be exploring how <i>cheap</i> has developed from the earliest uses of the word into how we use it in the present day. Please see the <a href="https://github.com/RJP43/OneWordHistory_CHEAP">related GitHub page</a> for project development details.***</p>
            <h1>The Etymology of <i>Cheap</i></h1>
            <h3>According to the Oxford Engligh Dictionary Online</h3>
            <p>The word <i>cheap</i> entered the English language in Old English as the noun <i>ceap</i> and had numerous initial meanings including: "barter, buying and selling, market, price, merchandise, stock, cattle." This word is derived from the Old Germanic word <i>kaupo</i> (hypothetical), which later became West Germanic <i>kaup</i> (hypothetical) and the Old Norse brother word <i>kaup</i>, meaning "bargain, pay, wages." The Old Germanic derivative West Germanic <i>kaup</i> (hypothetical) became the Old High German <i>chouf</i>, the Old English <i>ceap</i>, the Old Frisian <i>kap</i>, and the Old Saxon <i>kop</i>. The Germanic languages of the term have the hypothetical derivative verbs <i>kaupjan</i> and <i>kaupojan</i>,  meaning "to barter, buy and sell, etc." There is also the hypothetical West Germanic agent noun derivative <i>kaupo, -on</i>, meaning "trader, merchant." Quoted from the OED, "the coincidence of the stem <i>kaup-</i>, and especially the identity of the West Germanic  hypothetical agent noun <i>kaupo, -on</i> 'trader, merchant, dealer', with Latin <i>caupo, -on-em</i> 'petty tradesmen, huckster, tavern keeper', has suggested that the Germanic word and its family are of Latin origin. But there are serious difficulties."</p>
            <p>The Old English noun <i>ceap</i> took on copious spelling variations in Middle English including <i>chep</i>, <i>chype</i>, and <i>schep</i>. In the Middle English to the 1500s there was <i>chepe</i>, <i>cheep</i>, and <i>cheepe</i>. In the 1500s <i>chiepe</i> and <i>cheap</i> could also be found. The modern spelling, <i>cheap</i>, came in from Middle English to the 1600s and is the only variation used after the 1600s.</p>
