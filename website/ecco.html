            <p id="other">The samples from Eighteenth Century Collections Online were taken not as date ranges, but instead as individual years. I chose to sample from 1715 because I wanted an earlier representation of the 18th century than I had for previous centuries to see how rapidly the negative connotation on some adjective uses was increasing in a shorter period of time. I chose the sample year of 1750 as a representation of the century's middle and as a consistent point of comparison with the previous centuries sampled. In comparing the two years there are some distinct aspects I noticed. One point is that by the 1750 sample we see a representation of a new form not seen in previous centuries; the adverb. Also there is evidence that the adjective uses with a negative connotation found in the past century were becoming increasingly common.</p>
