            <p>In my research, I found there were a great number of times that the word <i>cheap</i> was used alongside another word as an idiom. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiom">Wikipedia</a>) "an idiom is a phrase or a fixed expression that has a figurative, or sometimes literal, meaning. An idiom's figurative meaning is different from the literal meaning." The OED defines the following two idioms in relation to <i>cheap</i>:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>cheap and nasty</strong>: of low price and bad quality; inexpensive but with the disadvantage of being unsuitable to one's purposes; hence cheap-and-nastiness.</li>
                <li><strong>cheap and cheerful</strong> (colloq.): simple, cheap, and pleasant.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>However, in my samples I found several others. Below is a list of the idioms I found in my samples and a brief description of my deduction of their meanings.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>good cheape and great plenty</strong>: I determined that in the use of this idiom from my <a href="../ebbo/1550-1560.html">1550-1560 Early English Books Online Sample</a> that <i>cheap</i>, or <i>cheape</i> as it appears here, is being referred synonymously with plenty.</li>
                <li><strong>cheap and easie</strong> OR <strong>cheap and easy</strong>: In this first use the idiom, from my <a href="../ebbo/1650-1660.html">1650-1650 Early English Books Online Sample</a>, <i>cheap</i> may be in the proper idiom fashion synonymous to <i>easy</i>, or <i>easiee</i> as it appears here. However, later in the passage there is reference to cost and money. Therefore I concluded that in this instance the use of <i>cheap</i> could be referring to the hyprid OED definition, of "involving little trouble and hence of little worth", which combines an instance of effort (much like <i>easy</i> is referring to in this sample) and cost. From this conclusion I determined that <i>cheap</i> sometimes is used in the idiom construction, but not as expected with interchangeable terms. In another instance found in my <a href="../ncco.html">1800-1820 Nineteenth Century Collections Online Sample</a> the context was more ambiguous and either of the two definitions could stand reason.</li>
                <li><strong>cheapness and meanness</strong>: How this idiom is used from my <a href="../ecco/1715.html">1715 Eighteenth Century Collection Online Sample</a> <i>cheap</i>, or <i>cheapness</i> as it appears here, has a very clear meaning referring to the inexpensiveness of the "Plaister" being discussed; however, <i>meanness</i> could either be following the typical idiom construction also referring to the price or be a determination of the average value the "Plaister" being discussed can have to the purchaser at such a low cost.</li>
                <li><strong>cheap and common</strong>: This is another instance when the use of <i>cheap</i> in the idiom construction made me question the intended definition. Found in my <a href="../ecco/1715.html">1715 Eighteenth Century Collection Online Sample</a> this use of <i>cheap</i> can either be referring to the meaning describing something that is easily obtained (relative to <i>common</i>) or as its own determination of affordability.</li>
