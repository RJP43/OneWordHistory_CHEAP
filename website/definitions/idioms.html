            <p>In my research, I found there were a great number of times that the word <i>cheap</i> was used alongside another word as an idiom. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiom">Wikipedia</a>) "an idiom is a phrase or a fixed expression that has a figurative, or sometimes literal, meaning. An idiom's figurative meaning is different from the literal meaning." The OED defines the following two idioms in relation to <i>cheap</i>:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>cheap and nasty</strong>: of low price and bad quality; inexpensive but with the disadvantage of being unsuitable to one's purposes; hence cheap-and-nastiness.</li>
                <li><strong>cheap and cheerful</strong> (colloq.): simple, cheap, and pleasant.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>However, in my samples I found several others. Below is a list of the idioms I found in my samples and a brief description of my deduction of their meanings.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>good cheape and great plenty</strong>: I determined that in the use of this idiom from my <a href="../ebbo/1550-1560.html">1550-1560 Early English Books Online Sample</a> that <i>cheap</i>, or <i>cheape</i> as it appears here, is being referred to synonymously with plenty.</li>
                <li><strong>cheap and easie</strong> OR <strong>cheap and easy</strong>: In this use the idiom from my <a href="../ebbo/1650-1660.html">1650-1650 Early English Books Online Sample</a> <i>cheap</i> could be used in the proper idiom fashion and be synonymous to <i>easy</i>, or <i>easiee</i> as it appears here. However, later in the passage there is reference to cost and money. Therefore I concluded that in this instance the use of <i>cheap</i> could be referring to the hyprib OED definition, of "involving little trouble and hence of little worth", which combines an instance of effort (much like easy is referring to in this sample) and cost. From this coclusion I determined that <i>cheap</i> is a word that sometimes when used in the idiom constuction is not intended as an actual idiom of interchangeable terms. In another instance found in my <a href="../ncco.html">1800-1820 Nineteenth Century Collections Online Sample</a> the context was more ambiguous and either of the two definitions could stand reason.</li>
                <li><strong>cheapness and meanness</strong>: How ths idiom is used from my <a href="../ecco/1715.html">1715 Eighteenth Century Collection Online Sample</a> <i>cheap</i>, or <i>cheapness</i> as it appears here, has very clear meaning referring to the inexpensiveness of the "Plaister" being discussed; however, meanness could either be following the typical idiom construction also referring to the price or be a determination of the average value the "Plaister" being discussed can have to the purchaser at such a low cost.</li>
                <li><strong>cheap and common</strong>: This is another instance when the use of <i>cheap</i>, in the idiom construction, made me question the intended definition of <i>cheap</i>. Found in my <a href="../ecco/1715.html">1715 Eighteenth Century Collection Online Sample</a> this use of <i>cheap</i> can either be referring to the meaning easily obtained (relative to <i>common</i>) or as it's own determination of affordability.</li>
