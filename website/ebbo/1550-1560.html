        <h1>Early English Books Online Sample from 1550-1560</h1>
        <div id="content">
            <p id="other">The results from the Early English Books Online (EBBO) Database for the middle of the 16th century (1550-1560) returned a greater presence of the noun use of <i>cheap</i> over any other form. However, there was some representation of the adjective use as well. The variety of meanings mainly included references to abundance and declarations of cost or more specifically affordability. I attempted to represent the inequality of form preference by choosing a majority of nouns for my sample. I also attempted to represent the variety in definitions by choosing a sample selection comprised of several years with a multitude of meanings present.</p>
