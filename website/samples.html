            <p>When determining the range of samples for this project there were two aspects of <i>cheap</i>'s history I want to focus on in my representation. My first goal was to show the change of use and variety of all the forms of <i>cheap</i> over multiple centuries. Next I wanted to determine a root in the cause of the noticeable connotation shift from the original, more positive meaning referring to a good bargain or general inexpensiveness into the modern and relatively negative uses as an absence of distinguishing quality and of being intrinsically worthless or generally unwanted.</p>
