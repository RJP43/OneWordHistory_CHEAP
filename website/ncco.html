        <h1>Nineteenth Century Collections Online Sample From 1800-1820</h1>
        <div id="content">
            <p id="other">I chose to sample a range of dates from the beginning of the 19th century, spanning the years 1800-1820, because it was relatively close to the latest year in the sample I had for the 18th century, yet with enough distance to see the rapidness of change in connotation. In this sample collection I focused less on the representation of forms and more on this change in connotation. I noticed that although all of the uses of <i>cheap</i> held consistent meanings to past centuries there was a distinct use of <i>cheap</i> in referring to items that were worth more to impoverished people. Perhaps the best example of this is from <a href="NCCO_sampleImages1800-1820/bibl6.JPG">Hannah More's writing</a>, in which she tells the tale of a woman that convinces wealthy parish members to only buy more expensive meat so to leave the cheap meat for the poor. Nowadays we see cheap as a description for something or someone with little value or of unfavorable qualities. The development of <i>cheap</i> in the 19th century referencing to inexpensive commodities for a lower standard of society is a likely predecessor of the negativity associated with the meanings of today.</p>
