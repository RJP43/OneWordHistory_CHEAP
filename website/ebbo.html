            <p id="other">Set side by side the samples from the following two centuries have several points of contrast and a few comparisons as well. In comparison, both samples represent the middle of the two centuries and contain representations of <i>cheap</i> as a noun and as an adjective. In contrast, the 16th century sample lacks any representation of the verb use; whereas, the verb is present in the 17th century sample. Also, there is an introduction of a new adjective definition with a more negative connotation in the 17th century. Follow the links below for a more detailed description of each century's sample.</p>
