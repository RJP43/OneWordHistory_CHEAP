                The following graph was modeled off of the <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams">Google NGram Viewer</a>. In a Google NGram Viewer <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/info">"when you enter phrases/words into the Google Books Ngram Viewer, it displays a graph showing how those phrases/words have occurred in a corpus of books over the selected years."</a> This graph varies from Google Ngram Viewer in many ways; however, it was still the base model. The graph below, similar to the Google NGram viewer, displays the frequency of a word within the available sample data over time. Aside from the obvious difference, one difference is that this graph focuses on multiple forms of a single word (<i>cheap</i>) based off of parts of speech instead of spelling variations or a different word. Another difference is that the sample data this graph used is only from the samples provided within the project versus an extensive selection of Google books.
