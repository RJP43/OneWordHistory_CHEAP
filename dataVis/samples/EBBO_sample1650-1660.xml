If the Son of God did not take flesh, then was not God manifested in the flesh; then the whole mystery of godlinesse which should be without con|troversie great and precious in the eyes of Christians, will be cheap, and vile, and of no account; for the whole mystery of godlinesse, 1 Tim. 3. 16. depends upon the manifestation of God in the flesh; Now the divine person of the Son took flesh; the person of the Father was not incarnate."</passage>

            <passage>"For Pride affects nothing more then Singularity; and therefore undervaluing the plain simplicity of ordinary Christianity, such as at first sight is held forth in the Gospel of Christ, they think it no small privilege to have a Prophet of their own; especially they getting this advantage thereby, that they can very presently, as they fancy, censure and discern the truth or falshood of all that venture to speak out of the Rode of their own Sect; as if every body were bound to conne their lessons according to their Book. And it is a fine thing to become so accurately wise at so cheap a rate, and discover who is Spiritual, or who is the Carnal, or meer Moral man. This is indeed the folly of all Sects, and there is no way better that I know, to be freed from such inveiglements, then by earnestly endevouring after that which they all pretend to, and to become truly more holy and sincere then other men; for the throughly purified man is certainly delivered from all these fol|lies."</passage>

But I doe not know that I let Farme to any Tenant, for more then I thought, (and I had some little skill) it was really and honestly worth, nor for more then, (had I been to have taken a Farme) I would have given for it my selfe. Nor have I any Tenant (though the times be now very bad) who shall say, Sir, my Farme is too deare, I cannot live upon it at the Rent, if he leave it to me but as good as it was when he took it, I will take it againe. Nay, notwithstanding Corn is so cheap, I give any Tenant I have, liberty to leave his Farme, and I will take it. I never did, or ever will, force any Tenant to keep his Farme.
